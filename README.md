# ghas-c-cpp

## TODO
Make an identical repo that is C, not C++

## Demo
### Automatic Mode

### Manual Mode
- easy, just change file to manual and add make clean, make
    - TODO: check if this is even needed. Not that the makefile works, does default setup work?
        - looks like the default setup does work!!! tested on a fork
    - either way, show them the comments in the file saying runner size affects analysis time

### Changing Severity Alerts
- Show the failure threshold under repo settings -> code security

### Copilot Autofix
